# ToolBuddy-Inventory-Management-System [in-development]
An inventory management system focused on management of various hardware, components, and tools in a technical workspace. This project aims to make 
engineering projects of all disciplines accessible for students or hobbyists that are new to the field. It does so by not only keeping track of their hardware, but storing 
information about the item, thus removing the barrier to entry of not knowing how or where to use a tool or component. This information can include what the item is used for, 
safety precautions, best practices, and more. ToolBuddy is intended to be used by university labs, departments, or even hobbyists looking for a solution to keep 
track of and store information about new tools.

The application was built using Qt, and is written primarily in C++. It also utilizes a MySQL database for information storage.

This project originated as the final project for StMU EG 1305.
